A file that we can use to put our individual paths into to avoid having them constantly pop us as changes in the files

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13630849/git-difference-between-assume-unchanged-and-skip-worktree

git update-index --skip-worktree [FILE]

--skip-worktree is useful when you instruct git not to touch a specific file ever because developers 
should change it. For example, if the main repository upstream hosts some production-ready configuration
 files and you donâ€™t want to accidentally commit changes to those files, --skip-worktree is exactly what you want.
